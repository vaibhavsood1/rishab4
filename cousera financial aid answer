I am an undergraduate student from India and I don't have any special source of income. My family income is very low which even resist paying my college fees. My college fee is also very high and I study there on an educational loan and a little amount of scholarship. I am already on a huge debt due to my college fees. It will take me years and years to repay it. I am not in a further condition to take another loan to study this course offline privately or paying online. In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money to pay for this course and get a certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid and will feel bless if i'll get the aid.




I want to complete Deep Learning Specialization on offer by deeplearning.ai. This Specialization will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in carrying out data science and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.
I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the online courses on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer-reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity. I’m taking this course to do research work. In graduate research level, this certificate will be valuable in my higher study education regarding in this field and I want to continue my research in Deep Learning field in future.
